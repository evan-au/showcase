# Expo application

Welcome to the Expo App.

## Project purpose

The project is aimed at showcasing some of the applications I have built or currently working on.
I am always exploring different ideas, architectures and solutions by building mini versions or full working versions of applications.

My work focuses around the Angular and Nx ecosystem and other tools that are integrated within the system.

The project is an ongoing work in progress as apps will be added incrementally over time.

I am currently seeking exciting adventures and opportunities in the frontend development field.
